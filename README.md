 # Introduction and Purpose:
   -  It is a basic e-commerce website designed for T-shirts for Men and Women. Users can browse products, and add, update, and delete the items to their cart.

# Tech Stack:
   - I have used React with Create React App as the base for the project. Additionally, I integrated React Router for navigation and used React-Context for state management.

# Project Structure:
   - The project follows a modular structure. Components like "Header," "ProductList," "ProductDetails," and "Cart,"  handle different parts of the application.

# User Interface:
   - The user interface has a clean and intuitive design, with a focus on showcasing products effectively. I utilized Mui Grid for layout and responsiveness.

# Navigation and Routing:
   - React Router is used for navigation. I defined routes for the homepage and cart page.

# State Management:
   - React Context  is used for state management. The global store holds information about the products, cart items.

# Array Filtering, sorting and Searching :
     On the Landing Page there is Header ,SearchBar ,category Panel and List of Cards, and also the user has provided with category panel which has color,type,gender as well as price. And also user has provided a search bar where he can write color-name or name of the item which he wants to search and adding that item into the cart.user can also use category panel, when user clicks on the category panel the orignal list of items displaying in the form of  cards will get filtered out and it will display the filtred list.so, let us suppose , if user selects the color red then  it call filter function that will filter out list of items which are the color red from the orignal list ,if he clicks on blue in same category then again that list will filter and add to the previous list of items , so now user will see the blue tshirt first and then red t shirts , so whatever the user clicks on input random check box ,array list gets sorted accordingly and it will get displayed according sorted lists of items,Now if the user cliks on different category panel , the new array will get sorted and store into useState hook,assume the user has clicked on the type-Hoodie  so the list will get sorted on type hoddie from the list which is sorted based on previous sorted item.if user has no click on the checkbox it will not show the sorted list .
So, Now if he again clicks on another category the same list will sort again according to category,so in this way the user can filter out the approtiate item which he wants to add into the cart.

# Data Retrieval:
   - I fetched product data from a mock API using Axios.


# Cart and Checkout:
   - Users can add products to the cart, update quantities, and remove items. The cart updates in real-time using React Context API.

# Conclusion:
    - Overall, this basic e-commerce website demonstrates my technical expertise in frontend development, including React, React context, and integration with external APIs for fetching data. It also showcases my understanding of user interface design.
